When I was in my 20s , I saw my very first psychotherapy client .
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley .
She was a 26-year - old woman named Alex .
Now when I heard this , I was so relieved .
My classmate got an arsonist for her first client .
And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys .
This I thought I could handle .
But I did n't handle it .
Work happened later , marriage happened later , kids happened later , even death happened later .
Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time .
But before long , my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life .
I pushed back .
And then my supervisor said , " Not yet , but she might marry the next one .
Besides , the best time to work on Alex 's marriage is before she has one . "
That 's what psychologists call an " Aha ! " moment .
That was the moment I realized , 30 is not the new 20 .
That made Alex 's 20s a developmental sweet spot , and we were sitting there blowing it .
There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now .
Raise your hand if you 're in your 20s .
I really want to see some twentysomethings here .
Oh , yay ! Y'all 's awesome .
This is not my opinion . These are the facts .
We know that 80 percent of life 's most defining moments take place by age 35 .
People who are over 40 , do n't panic .
This crowd is going to be fine , I think .
So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options .
But this is n't what twentysomethings are hearing .
Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood .
Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence .
It 's true .
As a culture , we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood .
Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things , you need a plan and not quite enough time .
Is n't that true ?
Nothing happens .
You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition , and absolutely nothing happens .
I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college . "
And then it starts to sound like this : " Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs .
Where are the twentysomethings here ?
Do not do that .
Okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high .
The post - millennial midlife crisis is n't buying a red sports car .
It 's realizing you ca n't have that career you now want .
I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking .
Here 's a story about how that can go .
It 's a story about a woman named Emma .
And as hard as her 20s were , her early life had been even harder .
Who 's going to take care of me if I have cancer ? "
Now in that moment , it took everything I had not to say , " I will . "
But what Emma needed was n't some therapist who really , really cared .
Emma needed a better life , and I knew this was her chance .
First , I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital .
By get identity capital , I mean do something that adds value to who you are .
That 's procrastination .
I told Emma to explore work and make it count .
Second , I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated .
That new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .
New things come from what are called our weak ties , our friends of friends of friends .
So yes , half of twentysomethings are un- or under - employed .
But half are n't , and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group .
It 's not cheating . It 's the science of how information spreads .
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now .
So what happened to Emma ?
That weak tie helped her get a job there .
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live - in boyfriend .
Now , five years later , she 's a special events planner for museums .
She 's married to a man she mindfully chose .
They are so easy to help .
Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX , bound for somewhere west .
So here 's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know .
It 's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex .
Do n't be defined by what you did n't know or did n't do .
You 're deciding your life right now .
Thank you .
But I wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ?
I started to imagine what this would look like .
Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D , and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen .
So with this tool , this boundary has been broken .
But our two hands still remain outside the screen .
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly .
So in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world .
But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ?
I 'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online .
But now you do n't have to worry about it .
What I got here is an online augmented fitting room .
What would such a future look like ?
Thank you .
But my tiger mother said , " No . "
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
That is me playing my imaginary piano .
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
But no adults liked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
My dream would never come true .
But that 's so unfair .
So I was determined to find another calling .
Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
I turned to books .
Books banned in China , of course .
" The Good Earth " is about Chinese peasant life .
That 's just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
That 's a topic for a different day .
" Honor , " I said . " That 's so different , and better , than obey . "
Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
It offers many insights .
It had never occurred to me , China does n't have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually carries somebody 's view .
Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
It 's a standard practice in the academic world .
There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
So I started reading books in pairs .
For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty -- interesting .
" Bride " in Chinese literally means " new mother . " Uh - oh .
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And I just curdled with jealousy that year , until I hatched my devious plan .
And then I did it .
I fiddled with my rival 's grades , just a little , just demoted some of those A 's .
All of those A 's .
So , in a frenzy , I corrected everybody 's marks , not imaginatively .
And I am still baffled by my behavior .
I do n't understand where the idea came from .
I do n't understand why I felt so great doing it .
I felt great .
I do n't understand why I was never caught .
I mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious .
I was never caught .
Jealousy baffles me .
It 's so mysterious , and it 's so pervasive .
We know babies suffer from jealousy .
We know primates do . Bluebirds are actually very prone .
We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States .
Well no faithless Helen , no " Odyssey . "
No jealous king , no " Arabian Nights . "
No Shakespeare .
And we think about Proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ?
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea .
We forget how harsh his vision was .
We forget how pitiless he is .
I mean , these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut .
I do n't know what cat gut is , but let 's assume it 's formidable .
When we feel jealous , we tell ourselves a story .
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists , and this is something Proust understood .
Now Swann and Proust , we have to admit , were notoriously jealous .
But you do n't have to be that jealous to concede that it 's hard work . Right ?
Jealousy is exhausting .
It 's a hungry emotion . It must be fed .
And what does jealousy like ?
Jealousy likes information .
Jealousy likes details .
Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair , the cute little pencil case .
Jealousy likes photos .
That 's why Instagram is such a hit .
Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy .
He says , " They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value . "
Grief , humiliation , loss : These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust .
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way ?
Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement ?
Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?
Freud would write about this later .
Because she 's blameless ; everybody knows it .
The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause .
Is she smiling too brightly here , or did she accidentally brush up against a man there ?
[ Freud ] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife 's unconscious .
The novel is very good on this point .
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy .
In fact , the more intensely jealous we are , the more we become residents of fantasy .
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive .
For a year . A year .
Because , I mean , let 's be real .
What immense , if misplaced , creativity . Right ?
This is something from a novel .
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel .
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine .
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters .
Take Tom Ripley , her most famous character .
That 's one way to go .
But what do we do ? We ca n't go the Tom Ripley route .
And it 's a pity , because we live in envious times .
We live in jealous times .
Does the novel show us a way out ? I 'm not sure .
Let 's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes .
Oh , it 's so familiar to me .
We 're proud of you . "
It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry , not emotion .
You know , one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade .
The next minute they 're on the same side .
Suddenly , Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he 's resented .
Could it be so simple though ?
Well , maybe then we would n't have to resent somebody 's excellence .
We could align ourselves with it .
But I like contingency plans .
So while we wait for that to happen , let us remember that we have fiction for consolation .
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy .
Fiction alone domesticates it , invites it to the table .
We are in excellent company .
Thank you .
It was a beautiful day .
The forest was sparkling .
We got to our campsite .
And I was astonished , I was very angry , and I was deeply confused .
That question stayed with me , and it simplified a little .
Who cleans up after us ?
Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London ?
I wanted to get to know them as individuals .
I wanted to understand who takes the job .
What 's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden ?
So I started a research project with them .
I needed to go deeper .
So I took the job as a sanitation worker .
I did n't just ride in the trucks now . I drove the trucks .
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow .
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education .
Everyone asks about the smell .
The weight takes a long time to get used to .
Then there 's the danger .
You 're in and out of traffic all day , and it 's zooming around you .
It just wants to get past you , so it 's often the motorist is not paying attention .
That 's really bad for the worker .
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash .
It never stops coming .
It 's also like a form of respiration or circulation .
It must always be in motion .
And then there 's the stigma .
They are the first guardians of public health .
Diseases we 've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us .
The economy needs them .
I 'm not advocating capitalism , I 'm just pointing out their relationship .
And then there 's what I call our average , necessary quotidian velocity .
By that I simply mean how fast we 're used to moving in the contemporary day and age .
Their work , I think , is kind of liturgical .
They 're on the streets every day , rhythmically .
They wear a uniform in many cities .
You know when to expect them .
And their work lets us do our work .
They are almost a form of reassurance .
We 're going to be okay . "
His name is Paulie , and we worked together many times , and we became good friends .
I want to believe that Paulie was right .
We are going to be okay .
It 's a remarkable statistic .
Take a moment to say thank you .
Hello , TEDWomen , what 's up .
Not good enough .
Hello , TEDWomen , what is up ?
My name is Maysoon Zayid , and I am not drunk , but the doctor who delivered me was .
He cut my mom six different times in six different directions , suffocating poor little me in the process .
As a result , I have cerebral palsy , which means I shake all the time .
It 's exhausting . I 'm like Shakira , Shakira meets Muhammad Ali .
C.P. is not genetic .
It 's not a birth defect . You ca n't catch it .
It only happens from accidents , like what happened to me on my birth day .
Come on a journey with me .
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces .
And you 're like , " God , ca n't I just be a little disabled ? "
Also , I got ta tell you , I got 99 problems , and palsy is just one .
If there was an Oppression Olympics , I would win the gold medal .
If you do n't feel better about yourself , maybe you should .
Cliffside Park , New Jersey is my hometown .
I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials .
My father 's mantra was , " You can do it , yes you can can . "
So , if my three older sisters were mopping , I was mopping .
Growing up , there were only six Arabs in my town , and they were all my family .
Now there are 20 Arabs in town , and they are still all my family .
I do n't think anyone even noticed we were n't Italian .
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith .
They did , however , seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan .
I have tap - danced on Broadway .
Yeah , on Broadway . It 's crazy .
My parents could n't afford physical therapy , so they sent me to dancing school .
I learned how to dance in heels , which means I can walk in heels .
And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore , I did not .
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga .
And now I can stand on my head .
I was like the pet lemur of the theater department .
Everybody loved me .
Every time I did a scene from " The Glass Menagerie , " my professors would weep .
But I never got cast .
It 's a play about a girl with C.P.
I was a girl with C.P.
So I start shouting from the rooftops , " I 'm finally going to get a part !
I have cerebral palsy !
Free at last ! Free at last !
Thank God almighty , I 'm free at last ! "
I did n't get the part .
Sherry Brown got the part .
College was imitating life .
Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able - bodied actors to play disabled onscreen .
My dream was coming true .
They only hired perfect people .
But there were exceptions to the rule .
So I became a comic .
Some people say I 'm the first stand - up comic in the Arab world .
Mainstreaming Arabs was much , much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability .
My big break came in 2010 .
I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show " Countdown With Keith Olbermann . "
And she looked at me and she went , " Five , four , three , two ... "
And we were live , right ?
Suddenly , my disability on the world wide web is fair game .
" Yo , is she retarded ? "
And my favorite , " Poor Gumby - mouth terrorist .
What does she suffer from ?
We should really pray for her . "
One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits : screenwriter , comedian , palsy .
Disability is as visual as race .
If a wheelchair user ca n't play Beyoncé , then Beyoncé ca n't play a wheelchair user .
The disabled are the largest — Yeah , clap for that , man . C'mon .
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world , and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment .
The doctors said that I would n't walk , but I am here in front of you .
However , if I grew up with social media , I do n't think I would be .
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life .
Perhaps if there were more positive images , it would foster less hate on the Internet .
Or maybe not .
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places .
I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Lorraine Arbus .
I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild .
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DNC .
So , we used to solve big problems .
The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States .
Apollo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
People died , including the crew of Apollo 1 .
But before the Apollo program ended , 24 men flew to the moon .
So why did they go ?
But Kennedy 's own words at Rice University in 1962 provide a better clue .
To contemporaries , Apollo was n't only a victory of West over East in the Cold War .
At the time , the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology .
They went because it was a big thing to do .
Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs .
In the middle years of the century , polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated .
Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler in 1970 called " accelerative thrust . "
Since 1970 , no human beings have been back to the moon .
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17 .
You hear it all the time .
We 've heard it over the last two days here at TED .
There 's nothing wrong with most of these things .
They 've expanded and enriched our lives .
But they do n't solve humanity 's big problems .
What happened ?
But I do n't think that explanation is good enough .
It mostly explains what 's wrong with Silicon Valley .
No , the reasons we ca n't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound .
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems .
We could go to Mars if we want .
NASA even has the outline of a plan .
But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal , and that will never happen .
Sometimes , we ca n't solve big problems because our political systems fail .
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind , and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels .
We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price . None exist .
Sometimes , big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so .
Famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply .
Finally , big problems sometimes elude solution because we do n't really understand the problem .
Hard problems are hard .
It 's not true that we ca n't solve big problems through technology .
But it is an irreproducible model for the future .
It is not 1961 .
Most of all , going to the moon turned out to be easy .
It was just three days away .
And arguably it was n't even solving much of a problem .
We are left alone with our day , and the solutions of the future will be harder won .
God knows , we do n't lack for the challenges .
Thank you very much .
I 'd like to invite you to close your eyes .
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home .
Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles .
They are competing in a naked bicycle race , and they are headed straight for your front door .
I need you to actually see this .
They are pedaling really hard , they 're sweaty , they 're bouncing around a lot .
And they crash straight into the front door of your home .
Bicycles fly everywhere , wheels roll past you , spokes end up in awkward places .
The light is shining down on Cookie Monster .
Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse .
It 's a talking horse .
You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose .
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he 's about to shovel into his mouth .
Walk past him . Walk past him into your living room .
In your living room , in full imaginative broadband , picture Britney Spears .
And then follow me into your kitchen .
Okay . Open your eyes .
It 's called the United States Memory Championship .
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies , widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep .
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers , looking at them just once .
They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers .
They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes .
They were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest .
I was like , this is unbelievable .
These people must be freaks of nature .
And I started talking to a few of the competitors .
And Ed was like , " I 'm not a savant .
In fact , I have just an average memory .
Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory .
Do you know Britney Spears ? "
I 'm like , " What ? No . Why ? "
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this . "
I was like , " Well I 'm not Britney Spears , but maybe you could teach me .
I mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ? "
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
I met a host of really interesting people .
This is a guy called E.P.
He 's an amnesic who had , very possibly , the very worst memory in the world .
The other end of the spectrum : I met this guy .
This is Kim Peek .
He was the basis for Dustin Hoffman 's character in the movie " Rain Man . "
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff .
Once upon a time , people invested in their memories , in laboriously furnishing their minds .
These technologies have made our modern world possible , but they 've also changed us .
They 've changed us culturally , and I would argue that they 've changed us cognitively .
Having little need to remember anymore , it sometimes seems like we 've forgotten how .
It 's actually not that singular , there are contests held all over the world .
And I was fascinated , I wanted to know how do these guys do it .
The answer was no .
Are they smarter than the rest of us ?
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests , and the answer was not really .
Why ? And is there something the rest of us can learn from this ?
This is my friend Ben Pridmore , three - time world memory champion .
That 's his name .
Do you remember what it was ? "
Same word , different amount of remembering ; that 's weird .
What 's going on here ?
Well the name Baker does n't actually mean anything to you .
It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull .
But the common noun baker , we know bakers .
Bakers wear funny white hats .
Bakers have flour on their hands .
Bakers smell good when they come home from work .
Maybe we even know a baker .
One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece .
It came to be known as the memory palace .
It does n't just kill everybody , it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition .
Nobody can say who was inside , nobody can say where they were sitting .
The bodies ca n't be properly buried .
It 's one tragedy compounding another .
And he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage .
So how does this work ?
What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house .
And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook .
I thought this was just fascinating , and I got really into it .
And I went to a few more of these memory contests .
And I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers .
But there was a problem .
The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event .
Truly , it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs .
I mean , the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples .
And I 'm a journalist , I need something to write about .
Maybe it was a poem .
Maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market .
And I found that this was shockingly fun .
I never would have expected that .
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory .
And I got pretty into it .
This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer 's training kit .
I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier .
And I had this notion that I might enter it , sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism .
It 'd make , I thought , maybe a nice epilogue to all my research .
Problem was the experiment went haywire .
I won the contest , which really was n't supposed to happen .
These are just tricks .
They are tricks that work because they 're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work .
Great memories are learned .
At the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention .
We remember when we are deeply engaged .
The memory palace , these memory techniques , they 're just shortcuts .
In fact , they 're not even really shortcuts .
They work because they make you work .
But there actually are no shortcuts .
This is how stuff is made memorable .
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us .
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools .
And like any teacher , I made quizzes and tests .
I gave out homework assignments .
When the work came back , I calculated grades .
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students .
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric I.Q. scores .
Some of my smartest kids were n't doing so well .
And that got me thinking .
So I left the classroom , and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist .
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy .
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out .
We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition .
We partnered with private companies , asking , which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs ?
And who 's going to earn the most money ?
In all those very different contexts , one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success .
And it was n't social intelligence .
It was n't good looks , physical health , and it was n't I.Q.
It was grit .
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long - term goals .
Grit is having stamina .
Grit is living life like it 's a marathon , not a sprint .
A few years ago , I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools .
Every day , parents and teachers ask me , " How do I build grit in kids ?
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic ?
How do I keep them motivated for the long run ? "
The honest answer is , I do n't know .
What I do know is that talent does n't make you gritty .
In fact , in our data , grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent .
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit .
But we need more .
And that 's where I 'm going to end my remarks , because that 's where we are .
That 's the work that stands before us .
We need to take our best ideas , our strongest intuitions , and we need to test them .
In other words , we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier .
Thank you .
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this .
Both projects are in emerging countries , one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia .
At first , the first thing I thought was , I want to run away .
And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia .
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions .
And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity .
So I thought , this is what I really want to design , not a shopping mall .
But the question was how we could do a multistory , contemporary building with these principles .
And it 's also between two parallel streets that do n't have any connection for hundreds of meters .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions .
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the Ethiopian women 's dresses .
That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade .
So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project .
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof .
Hopefully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction .
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis .
And for that I thought , what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment ?
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city .
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates .
These two examples , they have a common approach in the design process .
And also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing .
Thank you very much .
I think these are so commonplace , they 've become clichés of our society .
And I think there are three .
One 's a claim : there has been a great decline in trust , very widely believed .
The second is an aim : we should have more trust .
And the third is a task : we should rebuild trust .
I think that the claim , the aim and the task are all misconceived .
First the claim : Why do people think trust has declined ?
I do n't have an overview .
When you actually look at opinion polls across time , there 's not much evidence for that .
But is that good evidence ?
What opinion polls record is , of course , opinions .
What else can they record ?
So they 're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions .
Do you trust politicians ? Do you trust teachers ?
Now if somebody said to you , " Do you trust greengrocers ?
Do you trust fishmongers ?
Do you trust elementary school teachers ? "
you would probably begin by saying , " To do what ? "
And that would be a perfectly sensible response .
That 's a perfectly rational thing .
In short , in our real lives , we seek to place trust in a differentiated way .
I might , after all , know that she was n't a good driver .
Secondly , what about the aim ?
The aim is to have more trust .
Well frankly , I think that 's a stupid aim .
It 's not what I would aim at .
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy .
In fact , I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy .
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life .
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim .
It 's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects .
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things .
Are they competent ? Are they honest ? Are they reliable ?
But if , on the other hand , they 're unreliable , we might not .
If so , I have n't yet spotted it .
But that 's what we 're looking for : trustworthiness before trust .
Trust is the response .
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge . And , of course , it 's difficult .
A lot of these systems have the converse effect .
They do n't work as they 're supposed to .
You can all give your own examples there .
So so much for the aim .
Now thirdly , the task .
Calling the task rebuilding trust , I think , also gets things backwards .
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust .
Well , we can do that for ourselves .
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness .
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
But trust , in the end , is distinctive because it 's given by other people .
You ca n't rebuild what other people give you .
You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust .
So you have to , I think , be trustworthy .
But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
How to do it ?
Let me give you a simple commercial example .
That 's super . I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me .
I think there 's a big lesson in that .
So in the end , I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern .
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy .
You know , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch .
It totally dominated her imagination for months .
Her favorite character was Glinda , of course .
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand .
But you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
But " The Wizard of Oz " stood alone .
It did not start that trend .
Do you know what I 'm talking about ?
One is there 's very little violence in " The Wizard of Oz . "
The monkeys are rather aggressive , as are the apple trees .
Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer - generated armies of the Wicked Witch . "
But that 's not how it happens .
At that point I also had a son .
He was only three at the time .
He was not invited to the screening . He was too young for that .
But he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted .
And I wonder what he 's soaking in .
Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty ?
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government ?
Compare this to 1939 with " The Wizard of Oz . "
How does Dorothy win her movie ?
By making friends with everybody and being a leader .
I have n't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe .
I finished my quest , I got the girl .
Why are you still standing there ?
I do n't know what I 'm supposed to do .
There are plenty of exceptions , and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you .
There 's no models for them .
I recommend it to all of you . It 's on demand now .
Do you remember what the critics said when " Brave " came out ?
" Aw , I ca n't believe Pixar made a princess movie . "
It 's very good . Do n't let that stop you .
Now , almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test .
I do n't know if you 've heard of this .
So try to meet that bar .
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ?
Right ? Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff .
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test .
That 's Hollywood for you .
So let 's look at the numbers .
Eleven . It 's not bad .
But there is a number that is greater than this that 's going to bring this room down .
Last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
Here 's what it said .
One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life .
Now , I do n't think that 's the fault of popular entertainment .
I do n't think kids ' movies have anything to do with that .
Who are these guys ? What are they learning ?
What are they failing to learn ?
Are we soaking up that story ?
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood .
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down .
You 've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner .
They 're throwing it up in the air .
Obi - Wan Kenobi and Glinda .
What do these two have in common ?
Maybe it 's not just the sparkly dress .
I think these people are experts .
Now , they are leaders .
I want more quests like that .
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
I do n't know his name , but I do know his story .
He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
His village is near Mogadishu .
Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu .
Maybe a year passes , nothing .
He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
He is introduced to this young woman .
He eventually gets married .
He starts this new life .
He has a purpose in life .
One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
He was waiting .
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood .
And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
Often it 's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
70 percent do n't work , do n't go to school .
They pretty much do nothing .
What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood ?
Would I have become a terrorist ?
I 'm not really sure about the answer .
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
One of the young men in the room was Aden .
He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated .
There were no jobs , no opportunities .
They sought people like him out .
But his story takes a different route .
In Mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads .
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
He started a motorbike company .
He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who could n't normally afford them .
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity .
It 's entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
So Mohamed saw an opportunity .
He started a landscaping and design floral company .
There 's no public park in Mogadishu .
And he does n't grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
They had never really thought about starting up a business .
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .
For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
It 's about creating a social impact .
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
I believe he is selling hope .
Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him .
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
Thank you .
But you know , these shells , they 're hard to find .
They 're covered in sand . They 're difficult to see .
However , overtime , I got used to looking for them .
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them .
This grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and archaeology .
This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery .
For trying to map the past , I knew that I had to see differently .
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared .
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Bendix .
This area is huge -- it 's four miles by three miles in size .
So , how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape ?
So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape , very subtle changes .
We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow .
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists to do coring work , which you see here .
So , we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site .
" Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings .
There 's nothing like it in the land . "
So as it turns out , TED was not founded in 1984 AD .
It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective .
Thank you very much .
Ever since then , I was fascinated by this incredible language .
But to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China .
I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful .
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
Since we only have five minutes , it 's better that we have a fast and simpler way .
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy .
Today I 'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
You are ready ?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it 's square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person going for a walk .
This is a tree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
I call these eight characters radicals .
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
A person .
If someone walks behind , that is " to follow . "
As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd .
The person inside the mouth , the person is trapped .
He 's a prisoner , just like Jonah inside the whale .
One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods .
Three trees together , we create the forest .
Put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that 's " idiot . "
Easy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idiotic .
Remember fire ?
Two fires together , I get really hot .
Three fires together , that 's a lot of flames .
Set the fire underneath the two trees , it 's burning .
For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
Two suns together , prosperous .
Three together , that 's sparkles .
Put the sun and the moon shining together , it 's brightness .
It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
The sun is coming up above the horizon . Sunrise .
A door . Put a plank inside the door , it 's a door bolt .
Put a mouth inside the door , asking questions .
Knock knock . Is anyone home ?
This person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they have an argument .
Three women together , be careful , it 's adultery .
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 .
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
So after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It 's a volcano .
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .
This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China .
So a sun , origin together , we build Japan .
A person behind Japan , what do we get ?
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
Nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
